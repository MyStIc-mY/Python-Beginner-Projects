# 🔐 Python String Encryptor

A simple yet effective command-line tool to **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** user messages using Python's advanced String Slicing techniques.

## 🚀 How It Works
This project demonstrates logic building without using external libraries.
1.  **Encryption:** It reverses the user's input and appends a custom "salt" (garbage characters) to make it unreadable.
2.  **Decryption:** It intelligently removes the salt and reverses the string back to its original form using Slicing Logic.

## 🛠️ Technology Used
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Concepts:** String Slicing (`[::-1]`), Indexing, Concatenation, If-Else Logic.

## 💻 How to Run
1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Run the script in your terminal:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
