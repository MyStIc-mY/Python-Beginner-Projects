# 🎓 Student Management System

A Python-based Command Line Interface (CLI) tool to manage daily classroom activities efficiently. This project demonstrates the use of core Python concepts like Lists, Dictionaries, Loops, and Conditional Logic.

## 🚀 Features

This system allows the user to perform the following operations:

- **📝 Take Attendance:** Mark students as Present (y) or Absent (n).
- **📊 Record Grades:** Input and store CGPA for students.
- **👥 Student Details:** View a mapped list of Student Names and Roll Numbers.
- **📚 Subject Codes:** Fetch unique codes for subjects (MAT, CSE, etc.).
- **➕ Dynamic Management:**
  - Add new students to the class list.
  - Remove students from the records.
  - Update grades for newly added students.
- **🔄 Persistent Loop:** The program runs continuously until the user chooses to 'Exit'.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts Used:**
  - `Lists` (For dynamic student data)
  - `Dictionaries` (For mapping Marks and Subject Codes)
  - `Tuples` & `Zip` (For data mapping)
  - `While Loops` (For keeping the program alive)
  - `Try-Except` (For error handling)

## 💻 How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the code.
3. Run the script using the command line:

```bash
python main.py
